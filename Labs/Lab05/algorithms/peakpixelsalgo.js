//Requirements:
//Write markup and javascript to put a 100px by 100px square DIV on the screen with a background.
//We must make this div clickable and interactive for the user.
//When the div is clicked we want the size to increase by 10%.
//Travis provided us with a hint for this one.
//We must make a variable to store the height and width of the object within.
//Also, to set the height and width to what we want we set to varName + "px" with the desired height and width of the object. *div in this case*
//And, to make the div get 10% bigger, use the 1.1 * original size of the div.
//JS Code:
//let height_div = 100;
//let width_div = 100;
//let background_div = 'green'
//let div_1 = document.getElementById("peakPixels")
//document.getElemntById("peakPixels").height = height_div;
//document.getElemntById("peakPixels").width = width_div;
//document.getElementById("peakPixels").color = background_div;
//Then, I will have to make a function in js that can change the height and width of the div as well as add the color to the div.
//HTML Code: <div id="peakPixels"></div>
//Then we will obviously have to add the HTML structure along with adding the js script to the HTML file.
