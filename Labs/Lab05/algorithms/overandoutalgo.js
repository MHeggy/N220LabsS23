//This one is not so bad at all.
//I have to make another div that is 100px x 100px and has a blue background color.
//Using the onmouseover and onmouseout I have to change the color of the background for the div.
//I must  change the color to black when the mouse goes over the div.
//It must then change back to blue when the mouse leaves the area of the 100 x 100 div.
//Code:
//let color_over = "black";
//let color_out = "blue";
//let height_div = 100;
//let width_div = 100;
//function colorChange() {
    
//}
