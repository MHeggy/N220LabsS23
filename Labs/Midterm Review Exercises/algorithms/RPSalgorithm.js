//This exercise is a simulation of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
//We will make 4 divs for Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Guard.
//Then, I will also need to add a space for the score of the game that will be stored as a global variable.
//Generate a random move for the computer side.
//If the guard play is choosen, skip all the logic and deduct half a point from the user.
//Then we will basically just figureo ut the logic for a normal game of rock, paper, scissors that should not be too hard.
//I will use if and elseif statements here to figure the logic out and it should not be too tough.
//The hardest part will probably be figuring out what the score will be if both players choose the same option.
//In that instance I will either add +0 or +1 to both sides, I will see which option will work better for me and is less confusing to the user.
//Then, I will have to show the user what the computer and what they chose along with the score.
//Nothing too impossible to do, the HTML code won't be too tough, but make sure the logic is comprehensive and takes all possible outcomes into account.
