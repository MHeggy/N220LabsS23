//Creating a string array that lists at least 5 of my favorite things in it.
//Then, I have to write a loop that will write a div element onto each of them and will add the string "... is one of my favorite things."
//Code:
//let favoriteThings = ["Videogames", "Food", "Sleep", "Computers", "One Piece"];
//let d = document.createElement("div");
//function addWords() {
    //for(i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
        //d.innerHTML = favoriteThings[0] + "is one of my favorite things."
    //}
//}
