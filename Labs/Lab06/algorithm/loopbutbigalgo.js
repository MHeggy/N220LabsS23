//We are to write a loop that displays the numbers 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 in a single div. 
//There needs to only be one line of code in the loop.
//HTML Code:
//<div id="loopbutbig"></div>
//JS Code:
//let nums = [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000];
//let div = document.getElementById("loopbutbig");
//for(i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
    //div.innerHTML = nums;
//}
//I think this should be most of the code, the for loop is only supposed to be one line long so it should work just fine.
