//We are writing a loop that will loop 25 times for us. 
//It will write the iterand out into the page instead of inside of a div element.
//There are parameters although:
//When the iterand is divisible by 3, beep will be written onto the screen.
//When the iterand is divisible by 5, the word bop will be displayed instead.
//And when the iterand is divisible by both 3 and 5, the word beepbop will be written onto the screen.
//This set of code is rather challenging in my opinion.
//HTML Code:
//<div id="beepbop"></div>
//JS Code:
//let beepbopdiv = document.getElementById("beepbop");
//function randomInt(min, max) {
    //Math.floor(Math.random() * 25) + 1;
//}
//let randomNum = randomInt(1, 25);
//for(i = 1; i <= 25, i++) {
    //if(randomNum == 3,6,9,12,18,21,24) {
        //beepbopdiv.innerHTML = randomNum + "beep";
    //}
//then I will continue if and else if statements to complete the rest of the loop to provide me with the desired number and beep or bop.
//}
