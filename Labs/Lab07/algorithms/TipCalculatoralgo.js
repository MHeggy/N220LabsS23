//This assignment should not be too bad.
//I will initalize the variables for the total cost of the bill.
//Then I will use simple mathematical operators of js to get the total.
//JS: totalCost = inputName.value
//tipVal = totalCost.value * 0.2
//total = totalCost + tipVal
//then console log out the numbers, not too bad.
