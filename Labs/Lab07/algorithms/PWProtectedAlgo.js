//This is a little tougher but the user and password string simply have to be "username" and "password".
//JS Code:
//function check() {
    //if(username.value == "Username" && password.value == "Password") {
        //d1.innerHTML = "Success!";
    //} 
    //else {
        //d1.innerHTML = "Wrong, try again!";
    //}
//}
