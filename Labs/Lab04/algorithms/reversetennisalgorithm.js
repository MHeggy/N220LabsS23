//We must create two separate objects each with the listed parameters of 'x, y, width and height'.
//The rectangle will be an object per usual and will containt multiple parameters.
//The parameters will include x, y, width, height, for a tall rectangle.
//The function will also include interactive parts involving the keyboard and pressing a given key.
//The objects will move opposite of each other when the key is pressed down, I don't think this part will be too complicated.
//Code section:
//object_1 = {x: 40, y: 100, width: 40px, height: 70px, color: 'red'}
//object_2 = {x: 760, y: 100, width: 40px, height: 70px, color: 'red'}
//Setup section:
//function setup() {
    //createCanvas(800,600)
    //fill('black')
//}
//Setting up the functions to move:
//function moveup() {
    //if(keyIsDown(UP_ARROW))
//}
//function movedown() {
    //if(keyIsDown(DOWN_ARROW))
//}
