//This one should not be too bad to complete at all. 
//All I will be doing is simply taking my code previously from the ballbounce.js file and creating an object for the ball and using the parameters that I will set for the ball.
//Code section: 
//Setting up all necessary variables first.
//let ball = {x: 0, y: 0, radius: 50, speedX: 5, speedY: 5, directionX: -1, directionY: 1,}
//let canvas_1 = {x: 800px, y: 600px}
//Setting up the 800 x 600 px canvas!
//function setup() {
    //createCanvas(canvas_1);
//}
//Now setting up the function to draw circle and have it bounce off walls.
//function draw() {
    //background('black')
    //Making the ball
    //circle(ball.x, ball.y, ball.radius)
    //Motion
    //ball.x = ball.x + (ball.directionX * ball.speedX)
    //ball.y = ball.y + (ball.directionY * ball.speedY)
    //If statements to change direction
    //if(ball.x < 0) {
        //ball.directionX = ball.directionX*-1;
    //}
    //if (ball.y < 0) {
        //ball.directionY = ball.directionY*-1;
    //}
    //if(ball.x > width) {
        //ball.directionX = ball.directionX*-1;
    //}
    //if(ball.y > height) {
        //ball.directionY = ball.directionY*-1;
    //}
//}
