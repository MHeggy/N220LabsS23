//We are using inputs today, which I already have experience using luckily!
//<input id="userName" />
//They are an HTML tag so it makes the code quite simple.
//We can use them quite often and for a littany of different reasons and coding fun.
//Placeholder also is a nice thing that inputs allow us to use so generously.
//to access inputs we use document.querySelector and the ID of the element.
//HTML Code: <input id="txtName">
//JS Code: let txt = document.getElementById("txtName");
//We don't use innerHTML for inputs rather we use "value".
//txt.innerHTML == WRONG
//txt.value = CORRECT
